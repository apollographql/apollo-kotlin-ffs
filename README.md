## Apollo Kotlin Federation Foreign Schemas (FFS)

`apollo-kotlin-ffs` is an [Apollo compiler plugin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/compiler-plugins) that adds Federation [Foreign Schemas](https://specs.apollo.dev/link/v1.0/) (FFS) to the Apollo Compiler.

This is useful if you want to use Apollo Kotlin codegen with a schema that contains [federation subgraph directives](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/subgraph-spec). 

Those schemas are typically meant to be consumed by a server framework and not by a client. Clients should use introspection results or the [full schema](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/FullSchemas.md) after it has been processed by the server framework. 

Sometimes getting such a client schema is cumbersome. In those cases, `apollo-kotlin-ffs` adds the federation directives to the Apollo Kotlin compiler so that it can process the backend SDL.

> [!NOTE] 
> `apollo-kotlin-ffs` does not do any composition or any query planning. It is merely a tool to help clients validate schemas that are otherwise meant for server consumption.

To use `apollo-kotlin-ffs` in your project, add it as a plugin to your Apollo Kotlin service:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    packageName.set("com.example")

    plugin("com.apollographql.ffs:apollo-kotlin-ffs:0.0.1")
  }
}
```
